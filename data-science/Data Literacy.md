## Data Gaps
![[Pasted image 20231128195422.png]]
	**Garbage in, garbage out** is a data-world phrase that means “our data-driven conclusions are only as strong, robust, and well-supported as the data behind them.”
Part of understanding and communicating with data means **asking the right questions so that we end up with useful, relevant data**.

- Do we have sufficient data to answer the question at hand?
- Can my data answer my exact question?

## Addressing bias
- Who participated in the data?
- Who is left out?
- Who made the data?
